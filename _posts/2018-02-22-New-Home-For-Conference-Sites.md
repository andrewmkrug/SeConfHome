As the Selenium Conference grows each year and every year we create new sites to showcase the conference on the top-level domains for their respective countries. Since we have done the conference enough times now we decided we needed a home for all of the old conference sites and a single landing page for all future conferences.

We hope you like the new site.

Keep following this site for all events related to the Selenium Conference including when the Call for Proposals opening and new locations.
