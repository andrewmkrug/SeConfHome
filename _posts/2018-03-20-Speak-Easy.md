We welcome applications from less experienced speakers so we’ve partnered with [Speak Easy](speaking-easy.com) - a voluntary program designed to increase diversity and promote new voices at tech conferences through dedicated conference spots, mentoring and events. If you’ve got some great ideas and experience in automation, and a desire to speak for the first time at a conference, they’ll match you up with an experienced speaker who can mentor you through the whole process: from developing your idea into a great proposal and developing a compelling presentation, to delivering your presentation with confidence to an engaged audience. SeleniumConf has dedicated a track session for one new voice who comes through the Speak Easy program. Anyone registered on the Speak Easy site is eligible, so do sign up now and let us know you want a Speak Easy mentor’s help to prepare a SeleniumConf proposal.
