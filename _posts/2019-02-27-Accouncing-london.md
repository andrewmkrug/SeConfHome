We're thrilled to welcome Ash Coleman, Richard Bradshaw, Aditi Mulay and Petra Bouskova as our first invited speakers, and we're looking forward to welcoming many more through the CFP! Have you thought about joining their ranks? If youâ€™re passionate about Selenium (or related subjects) and want to share your expertise with the community then we would love to hear from you!

We've also just released to the conference and our in-depth training workshops and started accepting applications to our scholarship scheme. Head over to the website for all the details: [https://wvnts.co/2Suwp0Q](https://wvnts.co/2Suwp0Q)
